Tom likes to play online video games, however the chance that the randomized in-game matchmaking system will provide a good fit for teammates and/or rivals is far from guaranteed.  Too often, Tom is teamed up with (or against) players who leave early, talk trash, are over/under-skilled, too competitive, and/or are prone to rage quitting.  Gametime hopes to alleviate these issues by providing a user feedback system that allows players to evaluate other players via comments, endorsements, and gameplay stats.

* Upon first visit, Tom will hit the landing page and see what the page is about and what games are currently supported.

* Tom will be able to click signup button and use the signup page to register.

* After registering, Tom will see signup screen #2, prompting for setting self proclaimed play style (casual or competitive, 1-5) and gamertags.

* Tom will then be sent to the settings page to input what games they play.

* Once Tom has inputted at least one game, they will be able to visit the user directory.

* On the user directory page, Tom will be able to search for other users by username, or filter other players by game.  The table will be sortable by desired statistics.

* Tom can then select from the results a player they are interested in seeing more info about, which will take them to the profile page for that user.

* The profile page has data aggregated through APIs for each game the user has listed in their settings, giving a statistical overview of that player's performance.  This page also has a send message button for direct messages, and a Request Matchup button for making a request through the system to play a certain game at a certain time.

* The profile page lists positive/negative feedback ratio, endorsements, and user feedback comments.  Tom is able to increase or decrease any endorsement +/- 1 by clicking on the endorsement, or add new endorsements (from those registered in the system) by clicking the add endorsement button.
